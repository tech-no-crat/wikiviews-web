# WikiViews Web

A web interface for downloading historic, per-day article view count data from wikipedia.

The code that collects the data is seperated in its own npm package, [wikiviews](https://github.com/tech-no-crat/wikiviews). I've also written a CLI tool, [wikiviews-cli](https://github.com/tech-no-crat/wikiviews-cli).
